SpotifyTagger

Starting from Lucy-In-The-Sky-With-Emotion code, I wrote a simple spotify mood tagger.

It writes TAG on SPTY_* of TXX user Tags. An audio player like MusicBee will be then configure to highlight the new features, configured as "ratings"
Some hand work is necessary to configure visualization and filtering with these new SPTY_ tags
